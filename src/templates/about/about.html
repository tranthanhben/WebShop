			<p>The About Us page of your shop is vital because it’s where users go when first trying to determine a level of trust. Since trust is such an important part of selling online, it’s a good idea to give people a fair amount information about yourself and your shop. Here are a few things you should touch on:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Who you are</li>
				<li>Why you sell the items you sell</li>
				<li>Where you are located</li>
				<li>How long you have been in business</li>
				<li>How long you have been running your online shop</li>
				<li>Who are the people on your team</li>
			</ul>
